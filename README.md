# Sentiment-Analysis
This project builds a machine learning-based sentiment analysis system to classify Amazon product reviews into positive, neutral, and negative categories. The system demonstrates how textual data can be converted into actionable insights, helping businesses monitor customer satisfaction and improve decision-making.

The project focuses on handling class imbalance, evaluating models using precision, recall, F1-score, and comparing three traditional classifiers: Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Linear SVM
